# LibNetworking
## Archived
This was a learning project from 2018.
It was useful at the time for when I was learning to use C# for Networking purposes however it is not good code by any means.
It may be nice as a reference to how Networking can be achieved but nothing more.

## (Attempted) Features
TCP Client/Server Wrapper
Text and image sending capabilities. (Why is specified images at this time who knows.)
